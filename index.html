                    1.	Team name</br>
                </br>
                  My team name is The Flynn Brothers. This name comes from the famous cartoon, Phineas and Ferb, of Disney Channel. The cartoon is about two brothers who are able to create the most ridiculous, sometimes physically impossible inventions in their backyards, daily during their summer break. Therefore, I believe that my team that can produce the most innovative projects anyone can think of. </br>
              </br>
                  2.	Team profile</br>
          </br>
                  Based on the Myers-Briggs personality test that I took previously, I am an INTF, which is an advocate. Based on the analysis, I am a person, who value sincerity from everything and compassionate about his beliefs. From the ‘workplace habits’ section, it stated that I tend to work well with everyone, but better with people who value a respectful work environment, where everyone is equal and is free to express their thoughts and ideas. Therefore, I would like to work with teammates who share the beliefs of not making hierarchy their priority and be respectful toward others, as teammates. In my opinion, if the whole team share the same ideology, everyone can work with each other much more efficiently and the team’s chemistry would be exceptionally strong. Like a building, the most important thing is to build a strong foundation, or otherwise, it would eventually crumble down and turn into a pile of debris. As a result, I value chemistry more than the talent of an individual. I believe that the chemistry of a team is the key factor to its success. According the famous Michael Jordan, “Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championship.”

            <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div>
              <span
              >My project is to create a mobile that can assist people with disability, specifically people that have trouble with their vision, hearing, and ability to speak, with their daily lives. The app would contain different features for each category of disability to give the optimized experience for each user. With the help of the app, users can now be able to “see” what is in front of their phones’ cameras; can “hear” what others are saying; and are able to “speak” with their peers. According to WHO, there are about 285 million people that are visually impaired and of whom, 39 million are blind; and there are approximately 466 million people experience hearing loss. Also, even though there is no official statistic for the mute, there are still people out there have to live with the disability every day. As someone who is fortunate enough to have all of the senses available, I want to help this often-left-unnoticed population of human beings, by making their lives a bit easier by giving a small portion of their senses back. </br>
            </br>
                As described above, my app would provide the users their ability to sense again. The applications would have two categories or options: visually impaired/blind and deaf-mute. Each option is optimized to the need of each disability. First, for users with impaired sight, the app can act as their eyes, describing in detail what is in front of the camera. The features include a wide variety of scenario. With image recognition and AI, the app can analyze and detect hazardous objects or obstacles, and traffic signals to inform the users to prevent possible accidents. With machine learning, the AI can be fed with database of images of possible threat and taught to warn users during those scenarios. Users can identify people, who they talk to, their emotions, and their gestures through facial analysis, facial recognition and gesture recognition. Once again, the AI will be taught of facial features and gestures by getting fed the database of the according data to be to analyze and the detect the output. Users can use the app to analyze text to “read” with the help of text-to-speech software. This feature can be executed by implementing a text-to-speech software and the virtual assistant API, so that the virtual assistant can speak out what the text is for the users. The app can also be used to identify medication, household items, clothing or any object, with the help of AI and API database. Similar to Amazon’s products recognition, the users can use the app to identify the product by implementing image recognition and product image database API to identify the correct object. Next, for the users with impaired hearing, the app can translate their sign language to speech and translate what their peers said back to ASL-text/picture format on the phone display. This can be accomplished with AI complimented with image/gesture recognition, and speech-to-text features. The AI will learn sign language from the ASL database, and with image recognition, the AI would be able to detect the corresponding translation to each gesture and convert it to text for the users. For people who only recently experience loss of hearing and do not need the ASL translation feature, the app can also simply act as a notepad for the users’ peer to “write” what they said by speaking and the app would convert the speech to text with speech-to-text software. Also, the app can also run on the background to pick up sound cues, such as doorbell, fire alarm, etc., to alert the users. This can be done by feeding the AI with sound cues database and implement it with sound recognition software. For the mute users, similarly to the feature for auditory impaired, the app can translate their ASL gesture to speech and translate what their companions said back to sign language-text/picture format on the phone display. In rare cases, for people who just have the disability and have no knowledge of ASL, the app has an optional feature of verbalizing what they type with the help of the virtual assistant.</br> 
          </br>   
                From the description, there are a good number of technologies and tools that are listed. First and foremost, this is a project of a mobile application so a software for coding it is mandatory. There are many mobile app development software available, such as AppyPie, Appery, etc. Most of them can create apps for both system of Android and IOS. They are compatible for programmers of all level. Next, the cloud computing is the most important aspect of the project since the app need to implement many database and AI/machine learning. As a sub-category of cloud computing, AI is the factor that would determine the success of the app. AI is needed for computing, analyzing and giving the correct output that the users need. AI can be obtained from cloud-services such as Azure Machine Learning Studio, IBM Watson, Google Cloud Machine Learning, etc. Complementary to AI, there are countless databases applied to give the AI all the information it needed to be able to carry out the intended purposes. While database is the necessary material, image recognition and sound recognition are the necessary tools that allow the AI to make meaning out of the data that it absorbs. Most of the data can be obtained from the big companies’ database, like Microsoft Azure SQL Database or Google Cloud Database, etc. Virtual assistant is also essential to the project since it is the voice presenting the app. Virtual assistant can either be integrated from an existing one like Siri or Google Assistant, or I can program unique one for the app. Finally, although it is not mentioned in the description, cybersecurity is a mandatory technology for the app. It is needed to protect both the company and the users from possible cyberattacks that would steal away private information. </br>
      </br>
                The skills needed to create this project varies in level. To program the app, the basic knowledge of modern language programming, UI designing, cross-platform development, and back-end computing are essential. For a simple app, the level needed for these skills is the low to average, however, for an intricate app like this, the skill floor is quite high. This might impose some issues during the development of the app. With all the numerous APIs, complex coding to implement cloud services and AI, and tight security, it would take endless trial and error to create the complete product. Although the skill needed to create an AI is simple thanks to the user-friendly interface of current AI developing software, the AI needed for this project is complex, where it has to be fed an immense amount data and information and required to output specific results. Therefore, the most drawbacks would come during the process of creating this AI. Since the app also have access to the users’ phone microphone and camera, a data breach can be devastating, so the security of the app needs to be tight and complex to prevent any cyberattack. To find the personnel with such skill level, it can prove difficult. As for the software needed, most of them are available on the cloud-database so it is convenient for the team to gain access to them. </br>
  </br>
                If the project turns out to be a success, it will be a huge help to the targeted community of people with disability. They can now be much more independent than before. The blind can now walk and operate with confidence with the assistance of the app. The deaf-mute community can now freely communicate with everyone, without the language barrier. Although this app does not solve any of the major problems of the world right now, it sure will put smile on these often-forgotten souls. And hopefully, it will act as a callout for other developers to follow the wave and create better and helpful apps or software for people of all disabilities.

            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <span
            >For the feedback, I chose two friends that seem to be the most knowledgeable about the IT field in order to receive the most constructive opinions. Both agree that this project can be a huge renovation for the community, especially for the people with disability. However, they point out a few things that might obstruct my progress during the making of the project. According to friend A, who has experience of coding and programming, this project is extremely hard to execute due to its difficulty and there is a high chance failure. This feedback I absolutely agree with, but I do not take it as upsetting message but more of a push, a motivation for me to even try harder to make this project a success. It is true that as of now, I have yet to acquire any of the necessary skill in order to make this project come to life, but I will try to improve myself as a programmer in order to achieve this goal. </br>
        </br>
          On another hand, friend B, who is familiar with the start-up scene and has been researching it for a while, suggest that there would be no company that would invest in my project due its unprofitable nature. Since my app only target a small population of users, it might not attract investors as a good investment since they would probably need to spend more then earn from funding the app development. In a way, I do see my friend’s logic to his opinion, but I disagree with his view. I believe that there are companies out there, which are not just for the money but also want to take part in the process to better the community. Therefore, I will keep my optimism about this issue and only keep his feedback as a friendly reminder.

              <span
              >There are many technologies involved my project. However, in my opinion, there are 2 key factors that would be deciding if the project is a success or not. They are cloud computing and cybersecurity.</br>
            </br>
              1.	Cloud computing</br>
        </br>
              •	What does it do?</br>
    </br>
              Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services ranging from servers to database, storage, analytics, and intelligence. According to Flexera blog, 93 percent of enterprises in the US are using cloud as their main IT resources. These are the reasons why the cloud is attracting enterprises. First, cloud computing removes the cost of buying and setting up all the hardware and software, their necessary components such as datacenters; electrical fee for all the equipment; and the salary of IT workers that manage the infrastructure that host the components. By purchasing from the cloud, companies only need to follow the pay-as-you-go system for the services and all the infrastructures needed for the services are hosted by the cloud service provider. Next, big cloud computing services are hosted on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are often improved and upgraded to provide the fastest and most efficient computing performance. Then, most cloud services are always on demand and can be self-serviced, so businesses can acquire any amount of resources within minimal time. Finally, the cloud always makes data backup by mirroring the data in different redundant sites on the provider’s private network, so businesses do not have to worry about data corruption or data lost. There are 3 categorized types of cloud: public, private, and hybrid. Public cloud, such Microsoft Azure, provides all their resources, which are managed by the cloud provider, through the Internet. Private cloud is exclusive to one company or business. The cloud can either be hosted on the enterprise’s on-site datacenters or can be paid to get hosted on a third-party provider’s cloud server. Hybrid cloud allows data and application to move from private to public clouds and vice versa, which gives businesses better flexibility by allowing them to move workloads between clouds when needs and costs changes. </br>
</br>
              Even though cloud computing only exists within the last decade, there have been many applied uses of it. In fact, almost everyone who are using technology is probably using cloud computing. One of its most common uses is data storing, data backup, and data recovery. Emails and messaging apps (WhatsApp, WeChat, etc.) are the common way for people to communicate with each other during this modern time. Hundreds of thousands of messages and mails are sent through the Internet every single hour and all of them are never disposed but transferred and backed up in a cloud storage system. Therefore, even when you change to new devices and log into the accounts, the conversations and its data are still available thanks to cloud computing. The same can also be applied for your pictures, audios, documents when they are backed up on cloud storages such as Google Drive or iCloud. Streaming is a use, of cloud computing, that have gained popularity in recent years. Especially during this pandemic, the streaming services and industry has been on the rise. People are watching their favorite online personalities stream their gaming sessions, listening to their favorite songs or podcast from a music streaming platform, and binge-watching TV shows or movies from a video streaming service. With the help of data storage, music and movies can be stream to any device by transferring the data from the cloud storage to the devices. As for livestreams, the recorded data would be transferred to a designated server and the data would then be transferred in real-time to designated users. Finally, there is data analytics. Data is unified throughout the cloud of the enterprise, then AI and machine learning, which are also cloud services, get implemented to inspect and give insights of the information collected. Other than data storage, this is another main reason why cloud computing is attractive to cloud computing. </br>
</br>
                  As of now, there is no certainty of how cloud computing will improve in the next few years. However, there are some speculations for the improvement of the technology. First, with the help of IoT, cloud computing can enhance the performance of the Internet. As technology improve, IoT’s quality will also increase, which mean better communication between components of technology. Since cloud computing also works under the process of multiple components working together, it is inspected that with faster analyzing and computing, services and application can be loaded faster at much better quality. The speed of receiving and transferring data would also be quicker, and hence network is provided faster. Secondly, the storage of cloud would likely increase by a huge margin. As there are more usage of technology, a high volume of data is expected to be stored in the cloud. To solve this, cloud services providers are expected to create more datacenters to meet up with the projected increase of data surge. Finally, as technology evolve, so do cyberattacks. Although the security of cloud is adequate, it is not completely attack-proof. Therefore, cloud computing’s security is expected to improve the next few years, thanks to development of upcoming security methods, to fight back more advanced attacks. </br>
</br>
                  •	What is the likely impact?</br>
</br<\>
              The developments of cloud computing mean there will an increased usage of the cloud. As mentioned, the majority of enterprises are already implementing cloud services into their workflow. With cloud services being a big part of world’s industry, it can be assumed there will be a thrive in AI. However, due to its nature, AI is technically designed to replace human work. Therefore, this might affect the employment of the average workers or blue-collar workers. At the present, it can observe that workers such as customer service employees are already being replaced by automated AI receivers. As AI evolve, there would less available employment for jobs such as porters, janitors, or laborers in general since those occupation be can done by machine also. Other that, the rest of society should benefit from the developments of cloud computing. Enterprises, workers in the STEM field should benefit the most from this, since data is a big part of these areas of work. The entertainment industry should also gain a lot due to better Internet, which is equivalent to better streaming services, more innovations in the film and musical technologies, etc. The developments will hurt some but benefit a lot. </br>
</br>
              •	How will this affect me? </br>
</br>
              As someone who depend and has lives with technology since young age, the development of cloud computing, which lead to improvement of technology, would benefit my daily life. It would also help with the process of making the project more possible to succeed. As a student of the IT field, I would also gain more additional knowledge about the new developments of any IT areas and I can use those new obtained understanding to create better future projects. However, as technology get more advanced and complicated, my family, especially my parents, might have a hard time adjusting. As people who were born during the time when technology is not an essential part of life, my parents do not particularly are used to the new innovated devices. They still have difficulty using smart devices such as smartphone, TV, tablets, etc. So as more new things come out and implemented into the society, they might get “isolated” from the modern world and how it works. Nonetheless, I will try my best to get them used to the new technology in the future. </br>
</br>
              2.	Cybersecurity</br>
</br>
              •	What does it do?</br>
</br>
              Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting devices, programs, servers, networks, and systems from cyberattacks. In the modern world, everything is connected via the Internet and this increase the chance of one being attacked digitally. Cyberattacks’ purposes are to gain access, alter, and destroy private data and information in order to coerce money from the target and interrupt businesses. There are many types of digital attacks, such as phishing, malware, ransomware, etc. Within the protection circle, the three entities that are needed to be kept away from attacks the most are endpoint devices, networks, and cloud. And to protect these entities from harm, there are multiple layers of technology are used. </br>
</br>
              First, there is next-generation firewall (NGFW). Unlike the traditional firewall, which only perform stateful inspection and packet filtering, NGFW have all the features of the traditional firewall, in addition of integrated intrusion prevention; application awareness and control; upgrade path to include future information seeds, and techniques to address evolving threats. </br>
</br>
              Secondly, DNS filtering is the next layer of protection. DNS, or domain name system, is used to match a domain name to an IP address of a certain website. So, from the name, DNS filtering is the method of using DNS to block malicious contents by filtering out domain names that are harmful. Every time a user accesses a website, the device would send a DNS query to the DNS resolver, which acts as a filter by looking through the blocklist of harmful IP address that the business has collected. If certain website matches a result in the block list, the access would be rejected. </br>
</br>
              Then, malware protection and antivirus software should be the most familiar to users. Almost every endpoint device, which are being sold in the market, has a malware protection and antivirus software built in. Names such as Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, etc. are quite common as the pre-installed protection software of most Windows devices. They prevent malware and virus by deep-scanning files for existing malicious content and eliminate them. The software can also scan for harmful websites and set filter for website access to prevent breaching from the Internet. </br>
</br>
              Finally, there is email security solutions. Emails are an essential part of the modern world’s business. It is used to communicate with clients, employees and employers. It contains private information such bank account information, classified business talks, private personal information, etc. As a result, email becomes the prioritized target for cybercriminals. Email security software such as Sophos Email Security, Cisco Email Security, etc. provides prevention and protection from harmful contents that can be sent through email. The software acts as a firewall for your email platform, by inspecting and cross reference contents sent to you with a database of recorded fraudulent address, topics, and domain name. They can also encrypt your emails to prevent stolen data when there is breach. </br>
</br>
              As of now, there is no precise prediction of what cybersecurity can do in the next few years. However, experts expect a few upcoming changes of the technology. First, AI is still poorly understood at the moment and is always at risk of being a target for cyberattack. As a result, cybersecurity experts need to come up with new methods to prevent and counter the upcoming attack toward the AI systems. However, with how much AI is evolving, there is a chance that AI can be implemented and used to compute possible attack and create solutions for each scenario. Then, machine learning is expected to also evolve and help improve the techniques of cybersecurity. Machine learning can be used to identify reoccurring attacks and prevent them in the future. Together with AI, the combination can work together to create a strong detection system for attacks. </br>
</br>
                  •	What is the likely impact? </br>
</br>
              With the development of cybersecurity, people can be more assured about their privacy and private data being protected from cybercrimes. The development is equivalent to an improvement to the society, where people are always vulnerable to cybercrimes. Companies and business now can have an upgraded security system for their devices, clouds, and networks. This will be a boost to the economy, since there would be less damage caused by cyberattacks.  As the IT industry is growing day by day, the needs for cybersecurity expert will rise as more infrastructures are needed to be protected and more techniques need to be formulated for the unexpected attacks of cybercriminals. The demand for AI experts in general would also increase since cybersecurity is expected to involve a lot of AI and machine learning implementation. </br>

              •	How will it affect me? </br>
</br>
              Since my project deals with a large amount of clients’ personal data, the improvement of cybersecurity as a whole will tremendously help protecting my app database from having malwares and getting breached. Although technology is a part of my daily life, I have a rather strict technological lifestyle. Since a cousin of mine is an IT worker, he has taught to practice a discreet and safe habit when using the Internet. There is minimal personal data that I store digitally. As a result, it is nice to have an improvement in the cybersecurity system, but I would always be prepared for attack regardless. However, as mentioned, my parents who are not good with the modern technology, can take this development as an insurance for their cyber protection. As they have been involved with minor cyber scam, the updated security method can help my parents to be safe from such crime.

              >I had the chance to interview an undisclosed tech company’s IOS app developer, who happens to be the cousin that taught me all about the IT world. As an IOS developer, he works with other IOS developer to create any project that is given by the company. His work varies from time to time, as it depends on how the team divide parts during project initiation. As someone who has worked in the field for roughly 15 years, my cousin has gained wide range of knowledge regarding app development. As a result, he is often assigned tasks of different structure layers of the app. Sometimes, he will be taking care of the UI, and sometimes he is in charge of the logic code. </br>
            </br>
              Before the pandemic, my cousin would work on-site along with his colleagues. Every morning, they would have a briefing to share their work and serves as a report to see the progress of the whole group. Then, for the rest of his day, he will continue to code, with XCode, for the ongoing project, which is what he spends most of his time on. During his coding sessions, whenever he has questions about things, he tends to interact with his teammates for advice and work together to come up with ideas for the project. For most of his work, my cousin only interacts his team and occasionally, teams of other part of the project to synchronize their work and solve any existing problems. Surprisingly, according to my cousin, despite the large workload as the nature of a developer, the developers’ schedule is rather flexible, at least for his company. He said that his company has a working environment that promote a healthy mind. As a result, employees are not forced to work on a tradition 8-hour work shift. During work, if one needs to take a breather or grab some food, they are free to leave. As for my cousin, there are times when his mind gets clouded, he just went to the gaming area, which the company provided, and just spend a good solid hour there to free up his mind, and that does not get counted as his lunch hour. However, all employees are still expected to finish their tasks when it’s due, so most developers do not take the free work environment for granted and slack off. However, during this pandemic, my cousin had to work at home. During the time, he got fond of how nice it is to work remotely. As a result, with the permission of the company, he is now a work-at-home developer. His workflow is still the same, thanks to all the available technology, such as Zoom, Jira, Trello, etc., that allow efficient teamwork for people who work at home like he does. </br>
          </br>
              When I ask what the hardest part about his job is, he jokingly said everything is hard. Then, he explains there is some truth to that joke. Technology is always improving and evolving. New things come often. To remain an adequate developer, he needs to constantly learn the upcoming changes. It is exciting, but also particularly challenging. And as the nature of developing and coding, things tend to never work smoothly according to plan, and always require a tremendous amount of trial and error, which can sometimes be quite taxing on the mind. Nonetheless, he loves his job and how intriguing it is for him. </br>
